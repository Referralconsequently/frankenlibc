# FEATURE_PARITY.md

## Current Reality

Source of truth for implementation parity is `tests/conformance/reality_report.v1.json` (generated `2026-02-18T04:49:26Z`).
Reality snapshot: total_exported=3980, implemented=3457, raw_syscall=406, glibc_call_through=117, stub=0.
Counts below reflect that generated snapshot and will change as matrix drift fixes land.
Regenerate deterministically with:

```bash
cargo run -p frankenlibc-harness --bin harness -- reality-report \
  --support-matrix support_matrix.json \
  --output tests/conformance/reality_report.v1.json
```

Current exported ABI surface is **3980 symbols**, classified as:
- `Implemented`: 3457
- `RawSyscall`: 406
- `GlibcCallThrough`: 117
- `Stub`: 0

This means the current artifact is a **hybrid interposition profile** (mixed Rust-owned behavior, raw syscalls, host-glibc delegation, and deterministic stubs), not a full replacement profile.

Legend:
- `Implemented`: Native Rust behavior, no host glibc dependency for that symbol
- `RawSyscall`: Direct Linux syscall veneer, no host glibc dependency for that symbol
- `GlibcCallThrough`: Host glibc delegation with membrane pre/post checks
- `Stub`: Deterministic fallback/error contract (documented and testable)
- `DONE` / `IN_PROGRESS` / `PLANNED`: roadmap status for broader subsystem goals

## Macro Coverage Targets

| Area | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Exported symbol classification | 100% of current exports explicitly classified in support taxonomy | DONE |
| POSIX/GNU replacement completeness | Remove `GlibcCallThrough` + `Stub` classes from critical surfaces | IN_PROGRESS |
| ABI symbol/version fidelity | Preserve exported ABI and classify each exported symbol state | IN_PROGRESS |
| Strict mode conformance | Differential parity on supported symbol set | IN_PROGRESS |
| Hardened mode safety | Deterministic repair/deny coverage on membrane-gated paths | IN_PROGRESS |
| Transparent Safety Membrane enforcement | Pointer-sensitive APIs validated before dispatch | IN_PROGRESS |
| Conformance harness | Fixture-driven validation + drift gates | IN_PROGRESS |
| Benchmark gates | Regression-blocking + budget evidence | IN_PROGRESS |

### Hardened Safety Evidence (In Progress)

- Deterministic matrix artifact: `tests/conformance/hardened_repair_deny_matrix.v1.json`
- Gate script + harness integration: `scripts/check_hardened_repair_deny_matrix.sh` and `crates/frankenlibc-harness/tests/hardened_repair_deny_matrix_test.rs`
- Proof narrative + mapping: `docs/proofs/hardened_mode_safety.md` and `docs/proofs/repair_posix_mapping.md`
- Current matrix coverage is expanded but still bounded to currently fixture-backed invalid-input classes/families; additional membrane-gated families continue to be onboarded as hardened fixtures land.

## Gap Summary

1. ~~No Rust libc crates in repo yet.~~ Workspace scaffold with 6 crates created.
2. Initial conformance fixtures committed (`tests/conformance/fixtures/`); full capture pending.
3. Benchmark harnesses exist, but committed baseline evidence + regression thresholds are still pending.
4. Version script scaffold created (`libc.map`); full symbol/version verification pending.
5. No formal proof artifacts are committed yet.
6. Runtime math kernel is live in membrane and pointer validation; cross-family ABI wiring remains incomplete.
7. Sequential-statistical guardrails are wired with deterministic calibration evidence (`tests/runtime_math/risk_pareto_calibration.v1.json`) and enforced via `scripts/check_runtime_math_risk_pareto_calibration.sh`.
8. Bootstrap string/memory + allocator boundary implementations exist; initial strict/hardened fixture evidence is now committed (`tests/conformance/fixtures/membrane_mode_split.json`), full differential campaign remains pending.
8. Core allocator subsystem (size classes, thread cache, large allocator, MallocState) implemented with 50+ tests.
9. Stdlib numeric conversion (`atoi`, `atol`, `strtol`, `strtoul`), process control (`exit`, `atexit`), and sorting (`qsort`, `bsearch`) implemented with core logic and ABI membrane integration.
10. All string functions (mem*, str*, strtok, strtok_r, wide) implemented with comprehensive tests.
11. Tropical latency compositor live — min-plus algebra for provable worst-case pipeline bounds (math item #25).
11. Spectral phase monitor live — Marchenko-Pastur/Tracy-Widom eigenvalue edge detection for regime changes (math item #31).
12. Rough-path signature monitor live — truncated depth-3 path signatures in T(R^4) for universal noncommutative feature extraction (math items #24, #29).

17. Mean-field game contention controller live — Lasry-Lions Nash equilibrium via Picard fixed-point with logit best response, congestion collapse detection for validation resource contention (math item #19).
18. String/Memory ABI fully wired — `memset`, `memcmp`, `memchr`, `strtok`, `strtok_r`, `memrchr` now delegate to `frankenlibc-core` safe implementations after membrane validation; `memcpy` and `memmove` retain local logic due to strict aliasing constraints.
19. D-optimal probe scheduler live — runtime selection of heavy monitors via information-gain-per-cost budgeting with identifiability feedback in hot-path decisioning (math item #41).
20. Sparse latent-cause recovery live — runtime ISTA-based L1 controller infers concentrated vs diffuse fault sources from probe anomaly vectors and feeds strict/hardened risk escalation (math item #41 sparse recovery component).
21. Robust fusion controller live — online multiplicative-weights fusion computes `fusion_bonus_ppm` from cross-kernel severities, reducing double-counted noise while accelerating coherent multi-signal escalation.
22. Equivariant transport controller live — representation-stability/group-action canonicalization across API-family orbits detects cross-family symmetry breaking and escalates fractured runtime regimes (math item #43).
21. P-adic valuation error calculus live — non-Archimedean ultrametric regime detection for floating-point exceptional paths (denormal/overflow/NaN), with p-adic distance metric and regime-indexed guard tables (math item #40).
22. Symplectic reduction IPC guard live — GIT/symplectic moment-map admissibility for System V IPC resource requests, Marsden-Weinstein quotient deadlock detection, and stability certificates (math item #39).
23. Core `<math.h>` scalar functions implemented in safe Rust core (`trig`, `exp/log`, `float`, `special`) with bootstrap tests; removed TODO panics on numeric hot path.
24. ABI `<math.h>` entrypoints now runtime-math gated under `ApiFamily::MathFenv` with strict/hardened mode split and non-finite repair behavior wired into observation telemetry.
23. Higher-topos descent controller live — higher-categorical sheaf gluing axiom validation over locale fallback chains, EWMA-tracked violation rate with Calibrating/Coherent/DescentViolation/Incoherent state machine (math item #42).
24. Commitment-audit controller live — hash-chain commitments (SipHash), replay ring buffer (128 entries), supermartingale sequential hypothesis test with anytime-valid tamper detection for session/accounting traces (math item #44).
25. Bayesian change-point detector live — Adams & MacKay (2007) online Bayesian change-point detection with truncated run-length posterior (256-horizon), Beta-Bernoulli conjugate model, geometric hazard function, drift/shift/stable classification (math item #6).
26. Conformal risk controller live — split conformal prediction (Vovk et al. 2005) with sliding-window calibration (256 entries), conformal p-values, EWMA coverage tracking, distribution-free finite-sample miscoverage detection (math item #27).
27. Five new POSIX function families ported: `<unistd.h>` (27 entrypoints), `<sys/socket.h>` (14 entrypoints), `<arpa/inet.h>` (7 entrypoints), `<locale.h>` (2 entrypoints), `<termios.h>` (10 entrypoints). All routed through the RuntimeMathKernel via new ApiFamily variants (Socket=13, Locale=14, Termios=15, Inet=16). Core modules provide pure-Rust validators and constants; ABI modules wrap libc with membrane gating.
28. Six new runtime math monitors integrated: Malliavin sensitivity, Fisher-Rao information geometry, matrix concentration (Bernstein), Čech nerve complex, Wasserstein drift, kernel MMD. Total test count: 792 (up from 608).
29. `<dlfcn.h>` boundary locked — dlfcn boundary policy: interpose allows host call-through for `dlopen`/`dlsym`/`dlclose`, hardened invalid-flags repair is `RTLD_NOW`, replacement forbids host fallback; `dlerror` remains thread-local state.
30. Stein discrepancy monitor fixed — replaced mean-score-norm KSD (broken for deterministic inputs) with KL divergence D(current||reference) between live EWMA and calibration-frozen models; all 7 tests pass.
31. Five additional runtime math monitors verified: Stein discrepancy (KSD goodness-of-fit), POMDP repair (belief-space policy), K-theory (contract drift), SOS invariant (Lyapunov synthesis). Total test count: 792.
32. POSIX Batch 3: stdio file ops (27 ABI entrypoints wired via stream registry), process control (6 entrypoints under `ApiFamily::Process=17`: fork, _exit, execve, execvp, waitpid, wait), virtual memory (5 entrypoints under `ApiFamily::VirtualMemory=18`: mmap, munmap, mprotect, msync, madvise), pthread sync (15 entrypoints extending `ApiFamily::Threading`: mutex init/destroy/lock/trylock/unlock, cond init/destroy/wait/signal/broadcast, rwlock init/destroy/rdlock/wrlock/unlock), I/O multiplexing (4 entrypoints under `ApiFamily::Poll=19`: poll, ppoll, select, pselect). ApiFamily::COUNT expanded from 17 to 20. Total test count: 897.
